## Kalman Filter Ensemble-Based Tracker

Authors : Pedro Senna (pedrosennapsc@unifei.edu.br) , Isabela Drummond and Guilherme Bastos

_________________
Dependencies 

This code was tested in linux systems with the following specifications:

Ubuntu 16.04, probabily work on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 or Debian Jessie (8.5)

opencv 3.1.0

_________________
Quick start guide

mkdir build && cd build

cmake ..

make

Will be creator two binaries, "KF-EBT" to be used with the VOT tollkit and "KF-EBT_WebCam" that runs using a webcam.

In the KF-EBT_WebCam, select with the mouse the upper left corner and then the lower right corner of the object of interest in the image.
