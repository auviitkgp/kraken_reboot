# Introduction
CppMT is a method for visual object tracking.
It is the C++ implementation of CMT that was originally developed in Python by myself.
Details can be found on the [project page](http://www.gnebehay.com/cmt).
The implementation in this repository is platform-independent and runs
on Linux, Windows and OS X.

CppMT is freely available under the [Simplified BSD license][1],
meaning that you can basically do with the code whatever you want.
